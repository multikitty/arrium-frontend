              One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
              himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on
              his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could
              see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into
              stiff sections.
